# Booking Platform

A platform for booking tickets across multiple train companies.

## Description

Customers browse the trains that are available across different train companies and select one or more seats for their itinerary, which are stored in-memory as a quote. Once they have finalized their selection, they confirm their selected seats and receive a ticket for each one. All these tickets combined constitute one single booking that potentially contains tickets from multiple train companies. Meanwhile, managers for each train company or for the platform as a whole can retrieve aggregate statistics on trains and customers.
